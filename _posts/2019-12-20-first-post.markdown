This is the first post and has a lot of dumb stuff. Do not get scared. This is just me experimenting.

On one hand, this is an in-line equation $$x=1$$ and here is another one $$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$. On the other, this a fully-grown equation:

$$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\hat f(\xi) 
&= \frac 1{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)e^{-i2\xi\pi x}dx
&= 0.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
